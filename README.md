#  My Solution of THU uCore Lab

*uCore* is an educational operating system developed by the Computer Science Department of Tsinghua University, which comes with 8 lab exercises. 

To learn the principles of operating systems and related development techniques, I studied and completed these 8 exercises based on the x86 version of uCore during the summer of 2024. 

Now, I am sharing my solution code and study notes on GitHub to help those in need.
